# riscv-mktg

This is the repository for the marketing group activities. You'll find tasks in [the Issues tab](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-mktg/issues), and the Project Boards for the Working Groups in [the Projects tab](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-mktg/projects). The Wiki is empty for now, as we are using the Google Drive (link above) for content sharing.
